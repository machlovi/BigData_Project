Part1 has further 4 files labeled as: Part1,Part2,Part3,Part4.
Each part has it own mapper, reducer and test.sh file
Test-data is already included in the main folder. 
Due to size limitation we have provided a small part of the whole data.


In order git clone write the following command in your terminal:
“ git clone https://github.com/machlovi/BigData_Project.git “


This will clone the whole project file which includes all the required folders.
After cloning , edit your workers and manager by using vi command and then run bash install.sh.
Now you are ready to run the desired test.sh file by using bash test.sh from  the desired directory.


Note: test-data file is formatted as PVI2022.csv. If you have a different name/version then change the format in the test.sh file.
